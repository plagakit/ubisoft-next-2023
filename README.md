# Ubisoft Next 2023 Programming Submission

The theme for the 2023 competition was to make a game based on Bomberman but with a twist. My submission is titled _Oh No, It Seems Bomberman is Stuck in a Zombie Apocalypse, What a Predicament!_ and is a survival game where Bomberman fights of waves of zombies by kicking bombs at them. It got 3rd place in the competition! The engine features:
- Generic entity component systems
- Event-driven architecture using Signals
- Unit tests
- Bombs, zombies, explosions, and fun!
